# Java_BankAccount_App
This Java App can be used for online banking. It has an Account package that contains an Account parent class and 2 subclasses for Checking Accounts and Savings Accounts that inherit
certain methods from the Account parent class but operate differently with the Checking account managing its own Reward Point system while the Savings Account applies
a fee for withdraws.
